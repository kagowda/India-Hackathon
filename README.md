### 1.	LIFT AND SHIFT EXISTING .NET APPLICATION AS CONTAINERS USING SERVICE FABRIC

Among many scenarios where Azure Service Fabric shines, one of the latest has been the lift and shift legacy applications into Azure with minimal code changes on Service Fabric. With Windows Service 2008 and Windows Server 2005 getting out of support, there exists thousands of .net applications in want of supported environment. Many organizations are taking advantage of this situation and looking for ways to move their legacy business-critical applications into cloud with Service Fabric and why not? Azure Service Fabric gives your legacy application all the tested feature of scale, availability, reliability, and resilience in one shot with minimal code change.

The legacy application can be moved into Service Fabric by containerizing java legacy with Linux containers and .Net with Windows containers. As of now, Service Fabric is the only product that support moving .Net legacy apps with Windows containers into cloud. Through this challenge, we would like to showcase this momentum to all the partners, ISV, and customer participants in the hackathon.

Use following application in the repository for challenges 1.1 to 1.5- https://github.com/kagowda/India-Hackathon/tree/master/eshopwebformApplication/eShopLegacyWebFormsSolution 

#### 1.1.	Containerize legacy .Net application using Service Fabric as container orchestrator in Visual Studio

Build the solution and run the application to see an eShop web page in the browser.

In this challenge, containerize the typical Asp.net IIS application using Service Fabric. We have designed the challenge to not give any specific resources around this and find your way in Service Fabric docs. How‚Äôs that!! 

**Resources:**  
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/container-tooling-for-service-fabric/  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-host-app-in-a-container  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers  


#### 1.2.	Build and publish to local cluster and run application

Publish the container to local Service Fabric cluster and run the application. Take a point of the port you have exposed for service host in your manifest files. Use this port to access your application on local cluster. Remember your buddy, Service Fabric Explorer. Ha! Very detailed instruction, isn‚Äôt it? 

**Resources:**  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-host-app-in-a-container   
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-service-manifest-resources  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers   

#### 1.3.	Push container to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Simple challenge to create new Azure container registry and then push the above container image into registry. The previous challenges have created containers on your local machine. Find the container and push the container image to newly created ACR. Use your Azure pass subscription to create this resource.

**Resources:**  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-powershell   
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers#push-the-image-to-the-container-registry   
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/  

#### 1.4.	Create Azure Service Fabric cluster and access Service Fabric Explorer
Now let‚Äôs walk these containers to Azure. First, create Service Fabric cluster on Azure and deploy the containerized services to onto that cluster. Successful completion will leave you with a healthy Service Fabric cluster and container instances.

Do not move out of the challenge unless you can run your eShop application in a browser.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-arm  
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/create-service-fabric-clusters-visual-studio/  

#### 1.5.	Upgrade the application and parametrize environment variables
In this challenge, you will enable parameterization of application configuration for different environments. We will also roll-out an upgrade to the Service Fabric application. 

If you open SiteMaster.cs, we see that it reads environment variable ‚ÄúeShopTitle‚Äù to set page title. Let‚Äôs put environment variable in service manifest and parameterize this at application level and specify different values for local cluster and Azure cloud. 

Make changes and upgrade the application to cluster again. Watch the upgrade process through upgrade domains with zero downtime for your application. Also see how the title behaves differently in the local and Azure environment.

**Resources:**

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-upgrade-tutorial  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-upgrade-tutorial-powershell  

#### 1.6.	Add inter service communication with DNS

From here on ‚Äì Use the following application of eshopAppWithWepApi https://github.com/kagowda/India-Hackathon/tree/master/eshopAppWithWebApi/eShopLegacyWebAPI

Any complex application is going to have multiple services talking to each other and DNS is the natural medium to resolve another endpoint and connect to it (whatever may the transport protocol be). Service Fabric has an inbuilt DNS service which let‚Äôs you do service discovery inside the cluster without changing your legacy application code.  

This application contains a webapi service along with Asp.net eshopwebform application which you have already seen in above challenges. We have added a service to showcase the inter communication among services. 

The solution is already containerized for Service Fabric. Delete existing application in your Azure cluster by using Service Fabric explorer. 

Enable DNS for your cluster in Azure and update eshopwebform application to use DNS url of webapi to access the service.  Test the service locally and then publish to Azure Service Fabric cluster. Access your application and make sure everything is running the same.

**Resources:**  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-dnsservice  

#### 1.7.	Scale the containers by modifying the instance count of your containers

Azure Service Fabric makes it easy to build scalable applications by managing the services, partitions, and replicas on the nodes of a cluster. Running many workloads on the same hardware not only enables maximum resource utilization, but also provides flexibility in terms of how you choose to scale your workloads.

In this challenge, you will look at understanding manual scaling, which can also be done programmatically. But programmatical scaling is not included here, you can always explore more. 
##### 1.7.1.	Service/Container instance scaling
Look at your container instances in your cluster. You should see that containers are running on all the VMs as instance count for containers in your manifest is set to -1. 

Reduce the instance count to 1 and republish to observe the container instance count changes in Service Fabric explorer. You will see only one container instance running on one node. Now increase the instance count to number of nodes ‚Äì 1, i.e. 4 and republish. See how quick your container instances scale and start listening for new requests. 

Now disable one of the nodes that hosts a container instance from the cluster. Use Service Fabric explorer to do this, go to the node, click ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù and select ‚ÄúDeactivate (restart)‚Äù. Observe how the container instance on this node will be moved to another working node super quick.
##### 1.7.2.	Scaling with adding/removing nodes from the cluster
Begin by setting instance count to -1 for your apps/webapi and republish to Azure. Wait for publish to finish and see your container instance on all nodes. Now manually add new VM to your cluster and observe the changes. When a new VM is successfully attached to your cluster, Service Fabric automatically create new container instance and deploy on the new VM. 

**Resources:**

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-scale-up-down  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-programmatic-scaling  

#### 1.8.	Add resource constraints for your containers 

When you're running multiple services on the same node or cluster, it's possible that one service might consume more resources, starving other services in the process. This problem is referred to as the "noisy neighbor" problem. Azure Service Fabric enables the developer to specify reservations and limits per service to guarantee resources and limit resource usage.

In this challenge, add resource governance to your containers to run with 0.5 GB and 1 CPU core each.

**Resources:**

## Additional Challenges

Pick the challenge of your choice from the below list:

### 2.	SERVICE FABRIC MESH
Azure Service Fabric Mesh is a fully managed service that enables developers to deploy microservices applications without managing virtual machines, storage, or networking. Applications hosted on Service Fabric Mesh run and scale without you worrying about the infrastructure powering it. Service Fabric Mesh consists of clusters of thousands of machines. All cluster operations are hidden from the developer. Simply upload your code and specify resources you need, availability requirements, and resource limits.

Service Fabric Mesh is in public preview as of now and is planned to go General availability next year.

#### 2.1.	Setup your development experience 
You have to setup your development box before you proceed with Service Fabric mesh. Please follow the following links to get the dev setup. 

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric-mesh/service-fabric-mesh-howto-setup-developer-environment-sdk

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric-mesh/service-fabric-mesh-howto-setup-cli

Open PowerShell/ command prompt and type ‚Äúaz mesh‚Äù. If the command runs successfully then your local box is setup. 
#### 2.2.	Create a new .Net application and deploy on Mesh
You'll learn how to use Visual Studio to create an Azure Service Fabric Mesh app that has an ASP.NET web front-end and an ASP.NET Core Web API back-end service. Then you'll debug the app on your local development cluster. You'll publish the app to Azure and then make config, code changes, and upgrade the app. Finally, you'll clean up unused Azure resources so that you are not charged for what you aren't using.

The resource link below has the direction to source code that you can use to perform the exercise.

### 3.	ADD MONITORING, DIAGNOSTICS FOR YOUR CONTAINERS

Running and operating a distributed system is hard. Without good instrumentation and monitoring it is impossible. To ensure you have a good understanding of how the application is performing and where potential issues may occur, you should add comprehensive monitoring to the solution.

This challenge requires you to add extensive monitoring that covers the following 3 areas:
  * Application Monitoring 
  * Platform/Cluster Monitoring 3
  * Infrastructure/Performance Monitoring

#### 3.1.1.	Application Monitoring: 

Application monitoring is essential to understanding what the application is doing and if anything has gone wrong. When things do go wrong, the telemetry sent by the application is often the first place to look! Currently the application writes logs using each service‚Äôs own EventSource. This harnesses the power of ETW on Windows. ETW is rich, extensible and fast. However, without something to forward those logs off the node into a central repository, they‚Äôll be very hard to access and comprehend. This challenge requires that you add application level monitoring that allows you to see what the application is doing, how it is performing and what errors are occurring.

**Resources:**  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-overview#application-monitoring  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-event-analysis-appinsights  
https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-aspnetcore/wiki/Getting-Started#add-the-instrumentation-key-to-appsettingsjson

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-monitoring-wincontainers  

#### 3.1.2.	Cluster monitoring
When using a distributed platform such as Service Fabric, it is important to ensure you have deep insight into how it is performing and whether you need to take any action to mitigate issues. The Service Fabric agents write logs out to each node, you need to collect all of these into a central location for triage, alerting and analysis.

Some recommended approaches are listed below.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-setup  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-event-analysis-oms  

#### 3.1.3.	Infrastructure Monitoring
Service Fabric runs on a set of nodes (virtual or physical machines). In Azure deployed clusters this infrastructure layer is provided by Virtual Machine Scale Sets. We want to know how these machines are performing. This information is critical to understanding whether or not we have enough capacity in the cluster to handle our workload. Extracting key metrics such as Performance Counters and OS logs will help us build a holistic picture of the state of our cluster.

This challenge requires you to enable Performance Counters and set an alert for high memory and CPU usage across the cluster.

**Resources:**

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-agent  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-perf-wad  

### 4.	CI/CD PIPELINE 

For you to safely make iterative changes to the application code, it is important that you move from manually deploying updates to an automated system. This challenge requires you to create an automated build, test and deployment pipeline. Once you‚Äôve set it up, all modifications to the application should be pushed through the pipeline and into your cluster.

Your CI should build and test any code changes committed or merged on to your master branch. The build should then publish the build artifacts to a staging area that can be accessed by a release management tool in CD.

Your CD should pick up these build artifacts and execute a release into your cluster leveraging Service Fabric‚Äôs rolling update mechanism. You can apply additional items such as gated check ins, notifications and policies if you wish.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/accounts/create-account-msa-or-work-student?view=vsts  
https://about.gitlab.com  

### 5.	AUTO SCALE CONTAINERS 
Service Fabric provides facility to auto-scale your services based on load which they report, or based on their usage of resources.
Auto scaling gives great elasticity and enables provisioning of additional instances or partitions of your service on demand. The entire auto scaling process is automated and transparent, and once you set up your policies on a service there is no need for manual scaling operations at the service level. Auto scaling can be turned on either at service creation time, or at any time by updating the service.

In this challenge, you have an Asp.Net core application, which has been containerized and kept at https://github.com/kagowda/India-Hackathon/tree/master/autoscalechallenge. It comprises of a simple REST api which returns current server time after doing a fraud check (kept intentionally to make the calls computational intensive). 

During normal load the response time is ~300ms. However as the load or number of queries increase, the response time of the service also increases. To overcome this, we want to autoscale our service based on  [logical load metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-metrics), or with physical metric like CPU. Try to come up with the right policy and try it out on you local cluster followed by deployment on Azure cluster.

To aid you in this challenge, we've shared a simple [script](https://github.com/kagowda/India-Hackathon/blob/master/autoscalechallenge/PingParallel.ps1) which can be run your web service to induce load.

**Resources:**  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-autoscaling  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers#configure-resource-governance

### 6.	USING SERVICE FABRIC RELIABLE COLLECTION 

Service Fabric reliable collections enable you to write highly available, scalable, and low-latency cloud applications as though you were writing single computer applications. The classes in the Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Data.Collections namespace provide a set of collections that manage the replication and local state. Your reads are local while writes incur the minimum number of network IOs.

In this exercise, you have an Asp.Net core project in a Service Fabric Reliable stateful application ‚Äì VotingApp located at  https://github.com/kagowda/India-Hackathon/tree/master/reliablecollections. VotingApp has a frontend web server ‚Äì VotingWeb and backend server ‚Äì VotingData. Deploy this app and vote for your favorites. Now kill the VotingData process.

Do you see data loss? Checkout VoteDataController.cs. You will see that we are using a .Net concurrent dictionary to store data.

Your task is to change the code to store data in Reliable Collection. Make your changes. Deploy the app and kill the VotingData process again. Kill it as many times as you want, your data is safe with Reliable Collections.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-quick-start#create-a-stateful-service  

### 7.	 CREATE NEW WEB APPLICATION/MICROSERVICES AND DEPLOY TO SERVICE FABRIC

This challenge is your opportunity to get hands on building a new Service Fabric service. You can write this application using whatever framework, language or tooling you wish to. If you choose to use .NET, you can write a new .Net core application and deploy as guest executables or plugin to the Service Fabric Reliable services programming model. This is an open challenge, go wild!
